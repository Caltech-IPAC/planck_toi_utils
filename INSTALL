Planck utilities require the following libraries:

  cfitsio
    http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html
  CCfits
    http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/CCfits/
  armadillo
    http://arma.sourceforge.net/
  boost
    http://www.boost.org/
  hdf5
    http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
    This must be configured with c++ support
  libhires
    http://cerebus.ipac.caltech.edu/gitweb/?p=libhires.git
  libtinyhtm
    http://cerebus.ipac.caltech.edu/gitweb/?p=libtinyhtm.git

CCfits depends on cfitsio, and libhires and libtinyhtm depend on the
previous libraries.


Debian
------
On Debian, cfitsio, CCfits, armadillo, and boost are available through
apt.  The hdf5 usually packaged in Debian does not include c++
bindings, so you will have to build that yourself.
