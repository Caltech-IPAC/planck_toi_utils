Planck utilities are implemented in C++ 11.  This means a recent
version of gcc (4.7 or later).  Recent versions of clang may also
work, but has not been tested.

In addition, the Planck utilities require the following libraries:

  cfitsio
    http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html

  CCfits
    http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/CCfits/

  eigen
    http://eigen.tuxfamily.org

  boost
    http://www.boost.org/

  hdf5
    http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
    This must be configured with c++ support

  tablator
    http://cerebus.ipac.caltech.edu/gitweb/?p=tablator.git

  libhires
    http://cerebus.ipac.caltech.edu/gitweb/?p=libhires.git

  libtinyhtm
    http://cerebus.ipac.caltech.edu/gitweb/?p=libtinyhtm.git

CCfits depends on cfitsio, and tablator, libhires and libtinyhtm depend on the
previous libraries.


Debian
------
On Debian, cfitsio, CCfits, eigen, and boost are available through
apt.  The hdf5 package in Debian wheezy does not include c++ bindings,
so you will have to build that yourself.
