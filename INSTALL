* Quick Start

  If you have all of the dependencies, then you should be able to run

    python waf configure
    python waf  

  This will build the executable

    build/planck_toi_hires

* Dependencies

  The Planck utilities are implemented in C++11.  This means you need a
  recent version of gcc (4.7 or later).  Recent versions of clang may
  also work, but have not been tested.  You will also need Python.

** IRSA libraries

   If you downloaded this code via a tarball, it should include all of
   the necessary IRSA libraries in the directory
   src/third_party_builtin/.  Otherwise, the following IRSA libraries
   are required:

  tablator
    https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/tablator

  libhires
    https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/libhires

  libtinyhtm
    https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/libtinyhtm

  json5_parser
    https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/json5_parser

** External Dependencies

  cfitsio
    http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html

  CCfits
    CCfits depends on cfitsio
    http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/CCfits/

  armadillo
    http://arma.sourceforge.net/

  mlpack
    http://www.mlpack.org/

  boost
    http://www.boost.org/

  hdf5
    http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
    This must be configured with c++ support

*** Optional

  wcstools
    http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools/
    This is only needed for creating Planck index files.

*** Debian and Ubuntu

   Debian 8 (Jessie) and Ubuntu (14.04 Trusty Tahr and later) include
   packages for cfitsio, CCfits, armadillo, mlpack, boost, wcstools,
   and hdf5.  You can get the development libraries with the command:

     apt-get install g++ libcfitsio-dev libccfits-dev libarmadillo-dev libmlpack-dev libboost-dev libhdf5-dev libwcstools-dev

*** Centos 7

   Only Centos 7 has a recent enough compiler to build the
   Planck utilities.  You can get the boost development libraries with
   the commands:

     yum group install "Development Tools" 
     yum install boost-devel

   EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) has packages for
   cfitsio, eigen, and hdf5.  To get these packages, first enable EPEL

     yum install epel-release

   then install the packages

     yum install cfitsio-devel armadillo-devel hdf5-devel

   You will have to build CCfits and mlpack manually.  To build CCfits

     curl -O http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/CCfits/CCfits-2.4.tar.gz
     tar -zxf CCfits-2.4.tar.gz
     cd CCfits
     ./configure --prefix=$PWD --with-cfitsio-include=/usr/include/cfitsio --with-cfitsio-libdir=/usr/lib64
     make
     make install
     export CPPFLAGS=-I$PWD/include
     export LDFLAGS=-L$PWD/lib
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib

  Then you will be able to run the 'build.sh' script.
